Need way for await sh.command to return RunningCommand
I'm finally porting [Carthage](https://github.com/hadron/carthage)  from sh 1.x to sh 2.x. We had our own hack to enable async for sh, and we had a lot of code that did things like
```python
result = await sh.ssh(...)
```
And then for example looked at `result.stdout`.
So, part of this can be handled by setting `_return_cmd=True`, but the definition of `RunningCommand.__await__` is hard-coded to return `str(self)`.
Obviously, I can do something like
```python
result = sh.ssh(...)
await result
```
But that feels clumsy.
I'd like a kwarg that returns a RunningCommand even on async await.
My preference would be to try and convince you that `_return_cmd` should affect await as well as __call__, but if you are concerned about the API instability, I'm happy with anything that I can pass into bake.

Thanks for your consideration.
